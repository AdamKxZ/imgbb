# IMGBB Simple API Uploader
This is a simple script I wrote to upload images directly to ImgBB. All you need is your API key. 
Insert it into the apiKey variable and run the script. It will ask for the full file path. 
That's it!

# Future Updates
Currently working on a better, more refined version that allows for more convenient use for those less code savvy.
